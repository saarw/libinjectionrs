# Behavioral Analysis Results

This directory contains the systematic behavioral analysis of C functions before Rust porting.

## Structure

Each function gets its own subdirectory with standardized analysis documents:

```
analysis/
├── [function_name]/
│   ├── 1-algorithmic-understanding.md
│   ├── 2-data-flow-analysis.md  
│   ├── 3-invariant-discovery.md
│   └── behavioral-summary.md
```

## Analysis Phases

### Phase 1.1: Algorithmic Understanding
- High-level behavioral flowchart
- State machine analysis (if applicable)
- Execution path enumeration
- Function purpose analysis

### Phase 1.2: Data Flow Analysis  
- Input analysis and constraints
- Buffer manipulation sequences
- State variable modifications
- Output generation logic
- Error propagation paths

### Phase 1.3: Invariant Discovery
- Mathematical relationships
- Preconditions and postconditions
- Loop invariants
- Memory safety properties
- Implicit contracts

## Usage

1. Run Phase 1.1-1.3 prompts from `../PHASE_1_PROMPTS.md`
2. Save results in function-specific subdirectories
3. Create behavioral summary after all phases complete
4. Use analysis to guide exact Rust implementation

## Quality Criteria

Each analysis must be:
- **Complete**: Cover all code paths and edge cases
- **Precise**: Mathematical properties clearly stated
- **Verifiable**: Claims can be checked against C code
- **Implementation-Independent**: Focus on behavior, not code structure

## Key Functions to Analyze

Priority order for libinjection:
1. `libinjection_sqli_tokenize()` - Core tokenization
2. `libinjection_sqli_fold()` - Token folding logic  
3. `libinjection_is_sqli()` - Main detection logic
4. `libinjection_sqli_blacklist()` - Fingerprint matching
5. `libinjection_xss()` - XSS detection

Start with tokenization as it's the foundation for everything else.
